/**
 * The server-side cart of one table session.
 *
 * <p>Its rules are stateful rather than mere field checks — quantities accumulate across requests,
 * and whether a line may be added at all depends on another aggregate (the table invoice). That is
 * the reason Cart gets a domain model while Menu did not, under the same criterion applied in
 * issues #62 and #63.
 *
 * <p>The cart lives on the server, not in the browser, so that a customer who reloads the page or
 * switches phone mid-meal still sees what they picked. That also makes it the thing two devices at
 * the same table can edit at once, which is why quantity is expressed as a <em>delta</em>: "+1" from
 * two phones must end at 2, whereas "set quantity to 1" twice would end at 1 and silently lose an
 * order.
